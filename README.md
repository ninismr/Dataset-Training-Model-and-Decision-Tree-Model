# Dataset Training and Decision Tree Model using Python Programming Language
These are projects in my Coding and Big Data course. These projects are aims to do a dataset training model and decision tree model using a python programming language with several libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. 

The first project used gold_karat.csv is aimed to do a dataset training model. Training is a phase In Machine Learning that purposes for the machine learn the algorithm from data, we basically try to create a model to predict on the test data. So, we use the training data to fit the model and testing data to test it. 

The second project used titanic.csv is aimed to do a dataset decision tree model to predict the Titanic passenger's survival based on certain parameters such as (Passenger's Class, Sex/Gender, Age, and Fare).
